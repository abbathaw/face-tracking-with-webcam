## Face tracking and detection with webcam

Playing with an example repurposed from [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) for hackweek.

To start:

```
npm i
npm start
```

Browse to http://localhost:3000/.

This example is modified to only use the Tiny Face Detector and the webcam directly. All other non-related code has been reduced and removed. For the full examples, visit the face-api.js library itself.
